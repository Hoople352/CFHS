# Object-Oriented Programming



## Intro to Programming Paradigms

**Programming Paradigm:** A particular 'style' or 'way' of programming, plus the means by which programming languages are classified into groups thereof based on common features. We will look at two such paradigms for this topic: **Procedural** and **Object-Oriented** Programming (which you have already seen or have worked with in your coding projects!)

**Procedural Programming:** Basically sees an entire program as a giant procedure i.e. sequence of computer code instructions. In this paradigm, a program is 'broken up into' procedures (i.e. methods) and other control flow structures (e.g. loops, switches, conditionals) to operate on its data; with the focus being defining methods to perform such operations.

* **An Idea:** Imagine if there were no classes or other ways to separate data and operations on it into individual 'things'. Everything gets 'thrown into' the 
***main*** method except method definitions. How quickly would the code get cluttered?!?


**Object-Oriented Programming:** 








Testing Java Code:

```java

class TestClass{
  int hi = 1;
  


}


```
